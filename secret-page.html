    <h1>ðŸŒŸ You're My Shooting Star ðŸŒŸ</h1>
    <p>
        Hey <span class="love" onclick="registerClick()">Love</span>, this secret page is here to <span class="redirect" onclick="redirectToIndex()">reassure</span> you whenever you're not feeling great, or if you need a reminder that you're loved. Just remember, I'm here for you whenever you need me, and I'll be by your side through anything. Nothing will separate us. Relationships are about facing life together, both the good and the bad, and I want you to know that I'll always be there for you.

        Even though I might not always find the right words or ways to show my feelings, this page is here for you. Whenever you're feeling unsafe or unwell, just know that I'm with you in spirit, even if I can't be there in person. I'm sorry if I sometimes forget to say "I love you," but if I could, I'd tell you every second, every minute, and every hour. I might get on your nerves sometimes, but that's just my way of showing <span class="love" onclick="registerClick()">love</span>.
        
        I know things are tough for us right now, but that's why this page existsâ€”to remind you that you're not alone, even when we can't see each other for a while. But this is only temporary, and I know we'll soon have our happy life together.
        
        Finally, this message is meant to make you smile, so try clicking on all the "<span class="love" onclick="registerClick()">love</span>" words in the message. You might find a little surprise waiting for you. ;) ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’–
